modular_tools_data_struct_tree
==============================

based on https://github.com/vadimg/js_bintrees

added subtree size and overridable recalculations on rotations.

then extended red black tree with augmented interval tree according to the MIT open course ware "introduction to algorithms" lesson 10 (about interval trees)

then extended the AugIntTree with a SymIntTree (symmetrical interval tree) for faster multiple-interval and multiple-overlap retrieval.
